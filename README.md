## Python & Watson API
Utilizes IBM Bluemix - IBM Watson API in Python to analyze text input using the Watson Tone Analyzer.

#### What does it do?
Tone Analyzer leverages cognitive linguistic analysis to identify a variety of tones at both the sentence and document level. This insight can then used to refine and improve communications. It detects three types of tones, including emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy and sadness), social propensities (openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and emotional range), and language styles (analytical, confident and tentative) from text.
